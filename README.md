### Java Swing

Java Swing is a powerful and flexible framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications. It provides a set of components and libraries that allow developers to create interactive and visually appealing desktop applications. Java Swing is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is platform-independent, making it suitable for developing applications that can run on various operating systems.

## Result

Java swing is undoubtedly very powerful, although java is not so necessary for desktop systems nowadays, it is very useful to have knowledge of this technology.
