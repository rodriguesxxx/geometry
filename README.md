## Challenge
Our objective was to create 3 geometric figures using Java Swing.

### Java Swing
---
Java Swing is a powerful and flexible framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications. It provides a set of components and libraries that allow developers to create interactive and visually appealing desktop applications. Java Swing is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is platform-independent, making it suitable for developing applications that can run on various operating systems.

Java swing is undoubtedly very powerful, although java is not so necessary for desktop systems nowadays, it is very useful to have knowledge of this technology.
